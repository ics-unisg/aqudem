Cross-Correlation (CC),Activity,Frame,"When shifting the DET frame time series over the GT time series: At what shift are they maximally similar, and how similar are they at that shift?  (relative to complete equality for time series of that length)","`Lyon (2010)`_,  with zero-padding and input vector mapping to 1 when active and -1 when inactive",":math:`\mathbb{R}`,  :math:`[-1,1]` for shift of DET at which max CC occurs."
Two-Set (TS),Activity,Frame,"How many frames can be categorized as true positive (*tp*), true negative (*tn*), deletions (*d*), fragmentations (*f*), mergings (*m*), insertions (*i*), over-fillings at the start/end (*oa*/*oo*), under-fillings at the start/end(*ua*/*uo*)?",`Ward et al.
